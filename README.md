# Fancy counter with React

## Specification

- the app presents the user with a counter
- by default the counter starts at 0
- by default the counter will be incremented by 1 every second
- when the counter value changes, the app will display the new value using a nice animation
- the user can reverse the direction of the counter by clicking on a button
- the user can stop the counter by clicking on a button
- the background color of the application will change depending on the value of the counter read from redux (overkill, but nonetheless)

- Hooks
- CSS Modules
